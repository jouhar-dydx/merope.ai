#  Model Engine Module â€“ Low-Level Design (LLD)

##  Purpose
To run machine learning models for anomaly detection, combine predictions using ensemble methods, and serve model results via FastAPI endpoint.

##  Components
- Random Forest classifier
- LSTM time-series model
- Ensemble combiner
- Model registry
- FastAPI server

##  Data Flow
1. Load trained model from disk
2. Accept batch input from API or RabbitMQ
3. Predict anomalies using RF + LSTM
4. Combine results using weighted average
5. Return prediction + confidence score

##  Input Format
```json
{
  "features": {
    "cpu_util": 0.05,
    "tags_missing": true,
    "sg_open": true,
    ...
  }
}
## Output Format
```json
{
  "anomaly": true,
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "model_version": "RF-LSTM-v0.1"
}
